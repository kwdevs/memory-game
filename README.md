# Flip To Win aka (Concentration)
Flip to win is a simple game where you have 16 tiles each with a matching pair. Flip the tiles over by clicking an empty tile. If you find a match they will remain faceup.  If they do not match, a slight delay allows you to remember the cards before they are flipped back over. You win the game by finding all the matching tiles.
